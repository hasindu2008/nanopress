- motivation/objective

When a human DNA sample is sequenced using nanopore technology, around half a
trillion data points are recorded.
This also happens to be the surface area of the Earth in metres squared - so
we're talking about a lot of data here.
This data is regularly recorded, analysed and then archived for up to
10 years. As you can imagine, this accumulates a lot of data. For example, my
colleagues at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research produce up to half a
petabyte each year.
Storing this much data is not cheap

Using Google Cloud storage to archive this data would cost
up to 100 grand a year.

One solution to reducing these storage costs is lossless compression.

without losing any data.

does
not lose any data. The state-of-the-art compression method reduces the data to
34.1% of its original size. But this method does not consider the data's unique
characteristics. A specificall

Large data sets produced from nanopore sequencing are regularly recorded
and often require long-term archiving due to strict research and clinical data
regulations.
