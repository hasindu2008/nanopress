- motivation/objective

When a human DNA sample is sequenced using nanopore technology, around half a
trillion data points are recorded.
Half a trillion also happens to be the surface area of the Earth in metres
squared - so we're talking about a lot of data here.
This data is regularly recorded, analysed and then archived for up to
10 years.
As you can imagine, this process results in some very large archives.
To appreciate the scale of data being recorded, consider the Garvan Institute of
Medical Research. My colleagues at Garvan are producing up to half a petabyte
each year. Using Google Cloud storage to archive this data would cost up to 100
grand a year - that's not cheap.

One solution to reducing these storage costs is data compression.
Data compression represents data in a clever way which uses less bits than the
original.
The state-of-the-art compression method for nanopore data reduces it to
34.1% of its original size.
However, this method does not consider the data's unique properties. Therefore,
a more targetted compression method for nanopore data which understands its
characteristics should be able to compress it even smaller than the
state-of-the-art. This would then alleviate some of the financial costs that
come with archiving nanopore data.

Hence, my objective was to design a compression method which (1) outperforms the
state-of-the-art in terms of compressed size, and (2) is suitable for the most
nanopore applications. Now, I will present to you the background literature
necessary for understanding my work.

Lossless compression represents data using fewer bits without losing any
information.
Not losing any information means that the original data can be
reobtained through decompression. This is pretty handy - the only problem is
that compression takes time and uses computational resources.

Large data sets produced from nanopore sequencing are regularly recorded
and often require long-term archiving due to strict research and clinical data
regulations.
