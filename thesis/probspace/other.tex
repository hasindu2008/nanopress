Instead, each integer can be represented more space-efficiently by using $b<16$ bits where \[b(x)=\lceil\log_2(\max(x))\rceil.\] In this case, the compression ratio would be approximately $16/b$:
\begin{align*}
	\text{Compression Ratio} &= \frac{\text{Uncompressed Bytes}}{\text{Compressed Bytes}}\\
	&=\frac{\frac{16}{8}n}{\lceil\frac{b}{8}n\rceil}\\
	&\stackrel{n\to\infty}{\longrightarrow}\frac{16}{b}.
\end{align*}
A better strategy would be to initially transform the data such that its range is decreased.
%Let \[T=\{t\mid t:X\to Y\}\] be the set of bijections from $X$, the set of reads, to $Y := \{(y_i\mid y_i\in \mathbb{N}_0)\}$. One such transformation is defined by
Let \[T=\{t\mid t:X\to X\}\] be the set of functions from $X$, the set of reads, to itself. One such transformation subtracts the minimum of $x$ from each integer and is defined by \[ submin(x) := (x_i-\min(x)). \] Each transformed integer can then be represented using fewer than or the same number of bits:
%A better strategy would be to first transform $x$ by subtracting the minimum of $x$ from each integer. That is, $x\mapsto(x_i-\min(x))$. Then,
\begin{align*}
	b(submin(x))&=\lceil\log_2(\max(submin(x)))\rceil\\
	&=\lceil\log_2(\max(x-\min(x)))\rceil\\
	&=\lceil\log_2(\max(x)-\min(x))\rceil\\
	&\le b(x)
\end{align*}
since $\log$ is an increasing function.
%However, in practice each integer lies within $[2^7,2^{11}]$. This means each integer can be represented using 11 bits rather than 16. If each integer is stored using $b$ bits, the compression ratio would be approximately $16/b$ as follows:
%Hence, using 11 bits per integer results in a compression ratio of approximately $1.\overline{45}$. Note that the optimal $b$ is given by
Another transformation takes the differences between successive signals and is defined by
\[ \delta(x):=(x_{i+1}-x_i\mid 0\le i\le n-2).\]
