\subsection{The DNA Section}

\input{plots/dna300-section}

The large majority of the data consists of DNA sections so any gains in
compression discovered by understanding this type of section should
result in the largest compression gains overall. Recall that the DNA sections of
nanopore signal data are characterised by many low-variance subsequences of 10--100
data points with steep transitions between them. See Figure
\ref{fig:dna300-section} for an example.

The problem with compressing the DNA sections is that there are a lot of
apparent irregularities as is expected with information saturated sensor data.
Furthermore, the zig-zag delta transformation is quite fast and produces a lower
entropy distribution which is readily compressible making it difficult to outperform.
