\section{One Byte, Two Byte Exceptions}
\label{sec:vbbe21}
\input{plots/vbe21}

The one byte, two byte exceptions encoding, abbreviated to \textit{vbe21},
encodes a list of integers using one byte for each integer except for integers
which cannot fit into one byte, known as \textit{exceptions}, which are encoded
using two bytes. See Figure \ref{fig:vbe21}. Rather than using a control code to
mark where normal data and exceptions occur as in the Stream VByte codec
(Section \ref{subsubsec:svb}), the exceptions are encoded at the beginning since
it is expected that exceptions will occur with small probability.

The number of exceptions is written using 2 bytes, followed by the exceptions'
positions in the list using 4 bytes each, the exceptions themselves using 2
bytes each and finally the regular one byte data. For example, consider the
sequence of integers $1024,12,10,4096,0,1,2,1024$. There are three
exceptions 1024, 4096 and 1024. Hence, vbe21 would use
\[ 2 + 3(4+2) + 8-3 = 25 \]
bytes for this sequence. See Figure \ref{fig:vbe21-eg}.

Now, consider applying encoding $A$ to a read. Let $C_A:\Omega\to\mathbb{N}_0$
be a random variable measuring the resulting compressed size in bytes where
$\Omega$ is the space of possible nanopore reads. Then
\begin{align*}
	C_{vbe21} &= \text{exceptions} + \text{one byte data}\\
	&= (2 + 6X) + (N - X) \tag{$*$}\label{eq:vbe21}\\
	&= 2 + 5X + N
\end{align*}
where $N$ and $X$ are random variables measuring the read length and number of
exceptions respectively. Recall from Section \ref{subsec:prob} that the
probability that a zig-zag delta is greater than 255 and therefore outside the one
byte range is $\sim 5\times 10^{-5}$ for the data. Thus, the expected number of
zig-zag delta exceptions is
\[ E[X] = (5 \times 10^{-5})E[N] \]
%Also, the read lengths can be modelled by the Gamma distribution $\Gamma(1.0885,0.0096)$.
where the expected read length is
\[ E[N] = 113471.4 \]
from Table \ref{tab:n}. So $E[X] \approx 5.67$, that is we expect roughly 5 to 6
exceptions per read when using the zig-zag delta transformation.
Then, the expected compressed size is given by
\begin{align*}
	E[C_{vbe21-zd}] &= 2 + (2.5\times 10^{-4})E[N]+ E[N]\\
	&= 2 + 1.00025E[N]\\
	&\approx 113502 \text{ bytes}
\end{align*}
where vbe21-zd means first apply the zig-zag delta encoding then vbe21. In
comparison, using the Stream VByte 16 (or \textit{svb16}) encoding, the
compressed size is given by
\begin{align*}
	C_{svb16} &= \lceil N/8 \rceil + 2X + (N - X)\\
	&= \lceil N/8 \rceil + X + N.
\end{align*}
Then, the expected compressed size is
\begin{align*}
	E[C_{svb16-zd}] &= \lceil E[N]/8 \rceil + (5 \times 10^{-5})E[N] + E[N]\\
	&= \lceil E[N]/8 \rceil + 1.00005E[N]\\
	&\approx 127661 \text{ bytes}\\
	&> E[C_{vbe21-zd}].
\end{align*}

This translates into roughly 8 bits per data point for vbe21-zd versus
9 for svb16-zd.
%See Table \ref{tab:vbe21-bpp}.
Intuitively these numbers make sense considering vbe21-zd essentially represents
most points using one byte each and svb16-zd stores one extra bit per point in
the control byte section.  Compare this to the entropy of the data which is 7.70
bits per point or 5.39 for the zig-zag deltas. So it is clear that
vbe21-zd saves more space than svb16-zd: roughly 14 KiB on average per read or
an estimated 6.6 GiB for the whole data set. However, this is merely a container
for the data which is useful for downstream compression; alone it doesn't
provide great compression results as is obvious when comparing it to the entropy
of the data.

The encoding time complexity of vbe21-zd is linear since it requires
applying the zig-zag delta transformation and checking which values are
exceptions. The same time complexity is true for decoding since the inverse
process is conducted. Recall from
% TODO Section \ref{}
the literature review
that the time complexity of the Stream VByte codec family is also linear. Hence,
both strategies have the same asymptotic time complexity for encoding and
decoding.
