%TODO why lossless important
%TODO why not lossy
%TODO why per read

This thesis focuses on investigating lossless compression methods which are more space efficient and do not compromise analysis speed.
In order to not compromise analysis speed it is important that read decompression is able to be performed in parallel to take advantage of multi-threaded CPU design. That is, each read must be able to be decompressed independently of one another.
Necessarily this means that each read must be compressed separately, which is historically how nanopore signal compression has been performed.
% Why analysis requires parallel access of reads?

%and the primary desire of bioinformaticians is a better compression algorithm that does not sacrifice parallel querying.

Lossy compression, although an interesting avenue, is not desirable for most research applications where accuracy is more valued than storage space. For example, long-term archival of scholarly research data must be lossless to allow for public replication of any results.
% Example of long-term archival requirments
Hence, in this thesis I focus on lossless per-read compression and do not investigate multi-read or lossy compression strategies.
