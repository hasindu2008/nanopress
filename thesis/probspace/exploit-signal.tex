\section{Exploiting the Signal}

As discussed in Section
\ref{sec:data:char},
there are several predictable characteristics among reads which can be exploited
to gain more compression.
We have already used statistical information about the zig-zag deltas to our
advantage in the vbbe21 encoding (Section \ref{sec:vbbe21}) but we can even
further exploit the signal's characteristics by intimately tying this knowledge
to a compression algorithm. This understanding should improve the compression
ratio since compression is fundamentally an artificial intelligence problem of
understanding and prediction.
