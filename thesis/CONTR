The first thorough analysis of nanopore DNA signal data was conducted including
understanding its characteristic sections. A new state-of-the-art compression
method with a better compression ratio and the same theoretical compression and
decompression time complexity as the previous state-of-the-art was designed. It
combines a novel encoding of the signal data's zig-zag deltas with
domain-specific stall encoding and predictive range coding. An alternative
static huffman method is proposed which also has a higher compression ratio than
the state-of-the-art but not as much as the range coding method. The first known
software benchmark of nanopore signal compression methods was written and
provided for public access.
