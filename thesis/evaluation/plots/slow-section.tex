\caption{\label{fig:dna-section}An example of 3800 data points from a slow section in another randomly chosen read. It is characterised by extended low-variance sections between regular DNA sections. The 6-mers GTCCCA, TCCCAA and CCAAGT are mapped to the regions between the red and orange, orange and blue, and blue and purple vertical lines respectively. CCCAAG is also mapped to the orange-blue region but not as cleanly. In order from left to right the vertical lines are coloured red, orange, blue and purple.}
