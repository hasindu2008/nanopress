\section{Data} \label{sec:data}

The data consists of many sequences of unsigned integers known as \textit{reads}. Each integer represents the quantised ionic current recorded at a certain time step as a single-stranded DNA or RNA molecule is driven through a nanoscale protein pore (or \textit{nanopore}) \cite{Wang2021}. Disturbances in the ionic current caused by the molecule's biological structure can be used to determine its nucleic acid sequence.
