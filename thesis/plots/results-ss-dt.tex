\caption{\label{fig:results-ss-dt}The space saving versus decompression time (in
	hours per TiB) of various methods. The state-of-the-art method is
	coloured in red and the labelled methods are on the
	space--decompression-time frontier. That is, for each labelled method there is no other
	compression method which has a greater space saving and decompresses in
	less time. Figure \ref{fig:results-ss-dt-big} shows all the
	methods and Figure \ref{fig:results-ss-dt-small} shows those on the
	froniter with a space saving greater than or equal to the
	state-of-the-art.}
