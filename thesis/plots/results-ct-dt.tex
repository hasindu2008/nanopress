	\caption{\label{fig:results-ct-dt}A scatter plot of the methods which
	have a space saving greater than or equal to the state-of-the-art.
	Compression time is plotted against decompression time (in hours per
	TiB) and each point is coloured by its space saving. The
	state-of-the-art method zstd-svb-zd is in the bottom-left corner.}
