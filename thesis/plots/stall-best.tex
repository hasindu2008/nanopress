\caption{\label{fig:stall-best}A scatter plot of the compression methods with
the highest compression ratio on each read out of rc-vbbe21-zd and stall-fz. The
best compression ratio is plotted against the length of the read's stall. Reads
with a stall length $\sim$1500 and greater are more likely to be compressed
smaller with stall-fz rather than rc-vbbe21-zd.}
