\subsection{Signal Compression}

\subsubsection{Wavelet Compression}

A \textit{wavelet} is a brief oscillation which starts and ends with an amplitude of zero. Sets of complementary wavelets are desired for wavelet-based compression since they can reversibly decompose a signal. Wavelet transforms are more useful than Fourier transforms for approximating signal data with sharp peaks and non-periodic behaviour. Wavelet compression is most applicable to image data but has been successfully applied to audio and video data as well as electrocardiograph (ECG) signals.
