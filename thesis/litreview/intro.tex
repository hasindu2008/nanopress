Nanopore sequencing is a sub-topic of sequencing and gene informatics, all of
which belong to the broader field of bioinformatics. On the other hand, data
compression -- also known as source coding -- is founded on the principles of
information theory which lies at the intersection of statistics, computer
science and information engineering. In this chapter, we begin with a review of
nanopore sequencing and ONT sequencing devices.
The data compression fundamentals follow this, starting from the principles of
information theory and concluding with the state-of-the-art compression
method used on nanopore signal data.
