\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisors for guiding my research
and providing useful feedback on my writing.
Dr John Stavrakakis, thank you for always motivating me to do better and
inspiring me with new ideas.
Dr Ira Deveson, I am very grateful that you got me back into the office and
always value your feedback.
Dr Hasindu Gamaarachchi, thank you for helping me with any technical problems I
faced and for your quality humour. Also, thank you Daniel Lemire for generously
providing the \LaTeX source code for your Stream VByte paper \cite{svb} so that
I could modify and include your illustrative figures. Finally, a big thanks to
the computer science faculty for the ``CS Honours Room'' which was
always silent and had a nice view.
