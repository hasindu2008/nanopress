\chapter*{Abstract}

Storing DNA digitally is expensive as it heavily consumes disk space. Hence,
compression of this DNA data is highly desirable. However, for efficient
analysis of this data, decompression time must not be overwhelming. A balance
between the compression rate and decompression time should be taken.
