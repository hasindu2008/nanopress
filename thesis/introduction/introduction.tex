Nanopore sequencing is used to determine the nucleotide sequence (A, C, T or U, and G) of a DNA or RNA molecule.
It typically produces around 1 TiB of data for a human DNA sequencing run.
% How many runs by some well known institute or project to put into perspective?
The Genomic Technologies Group at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research regularly perform 5-10 clinical human DNA sequencing runs a week which need to be archived for up to 10 years. This amounts to between 260 and 520 TiB a year.
% How much data produced in certain years, for different projects, etc. ?

Around 3 billion bases in the human genome.
Each base is recorded by roughly 10 signal points (=30 billion points).
2 bytes per integer (=60 GiB)
To increase sequencing accuracy each base is recorded many times over. For 20 x coverage (=1 TiB)
Many labs doing human DNA sequencing at a large rate.
