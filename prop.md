Computer Science Honours Proposal
=================================


Introduction
------------

Nanopore sequencing has become quite popular in the genome sequencing domain due to its many advantages over previous generations of sequencers. However, the size of data produced by nanopore sequencers is quite large (terabytes in size). This raw data is a series of integers that represent the pico-ampere range current signal when DNA strands pass through protein nanopores. Currently, generic compression algorithms such as zlib, z-standard and stream variable bytes are used for compressing this raw signal data. Compressed data size is around 1-2TB for a single sample.

Objective
---------

To improve upon the state of the art for compressing data in the field domain of Nanopore genome sequencing.

Methodology
-----------

The project will involve

- investigation of the properties of Nanopore raw signals,
- design of new algorithms via
   - mathematical proof;
   - data driven iterative testing;
   - heuristic based approaches, and
 - understanding of how the data is acquired and used.

Evaluation
----------

To evaluate the project against its objective, compression benchmarking of existing data will be performed to compare against existing algorithms.

Supervisors
-----------

It has been organised that Dr John Stavrakakis will be the main University of Sydney supervisor from the School of Computer Science. Whilst, Dr Hasindu Gamaarachchi and Dr Ira Deveson from the Garvan Institute of Medical Research will be co-supervisors.
